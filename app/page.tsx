  // No "Best" or "#1" here, on purpose, same reasoning as the H1 comment in
  // HeroSection.tsx: it is an unverifiable superlative about the business
  // itself, which reads as a negative E-E-A-T signal, and in most markets a
  // comparative claim in advertising needs substantiation this site does not
  // publish. Ranking for "best software house in islamabad" searches comes
  // from what the page demonstrates, not from the word "best" sitting in the
  // title tag — Google resolves that query by relevance and trust signals, not
  // by string-matching a superlative.
