/**
 * The four platforms get SoftwareApplication entities rather than a bare
 * ItemList of fragment URLs. Fragments are not documents, so the previous
 * markup pointed four list items at one page. No `offers` block is emitted:
 * pricing is quote-based and is not published, and stating a price of 0 to
 * satisfy a validator would be a misrepresentation.
 *
 * BreadcrumbList is no longer declared here — SolutionsHero renders it via the
 * shared Breadcrumbs component, and two competing declarations on one page is
 * how breadcrumb display gets dropped from the SERP.
