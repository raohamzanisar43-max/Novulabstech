 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * /portfolio previously held ten project cards of roughly 30 words each on a
 * single URL, every card linking only to /contact. Case study pages are the
 * highest-converting page type in B2B enterprise software and the site had
 * zero of them.
 *
 * ATTRIBUTION POLICY, read before editing.
 *
 * The previous cards attached precise metrics ("$2.4B annual transactions",
 * "40+ hospitals") to invented product names ("TranzAxis Payment Gateway").
 * The specificity of the numbers makes the anonymity look worse, not better:
 * a reader cannot distinguish NDA-protected fact from invention, which is the
 * opposite of the intended effect.
 *
 * The standard NDA pattern is used instead: describe the client by verifiable
 * category ("a Tier-1 commercial bank in Pakistan, name withheld under NDA"),
 * keep the product name as an internal project codename and label it as one,
 * and mark every metric with its provenance.
 *
 * ⚠️ CLIENT ACTION REQUIRED: every entry below carries `metricsVerified: false`.
 * Before publishing, confirm each figure against delivery records and flip the
 * flag, or delete the figure. Unverifiable quantified claims in a YMYL vertical
 * are worse than no claim at all. The template renders a provenance note while
 * the flag is false.
