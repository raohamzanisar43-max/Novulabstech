/**
 * Dedicated service pages.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * The site previously carried 22 services on a single /services URL with only
 * fragment anchors (/services#fintech, /services#compliance, …). A URL fragment
 * is not a document: Google indexes one page, so ~1,200 words had to represent
 * 22 distinct commercial intents — roughly 55 words per service. A competitor
 * with a dedicated 1,500-word page on one of those intents wins that comparison
 * mechanically, regardless of domain authority.
 *
 * This splits the commercial surface into seven intent-matched documents, each
 * with its own clean URL, H1, title, description, FAQ and Service schema.
 * /services survives as a hub that links to all seven.
 *
 * Content rule: no metric, client name or certification appears here unless it
 * already appears elsewhere on the site and the client can evidence it. Where a
 * claim needed evidence we did not have, it was written as a description of
 * method rather than a claim of result.
