// links to real content about the same underlying capability.

  { q: 'Do you offer post-launch support and maintenance?', a: 'Yes. Tiered SLA packages from standard business-hours support to 24/7 platinum tiers with 4-hour guaranteed response. All enterprise clients get a dedicated account manager.' },
  { q: 'Are your solutions compliant with FMU Pakistan regulations?', a: 'Absolutely. We have live deployments at multiple SBP-regulated institutions: GOAML integration, STR/CTR reporting, AML/CFT screening, all under FMU and FATF frameworks.' },
  { q: 'Can you work alongside our existing team?', a: 'Yes. Staff augmentation, co-development, and full outsourcing: we adapt to your stack, tools, and methodologies. Many clients embed our engineers alongside their in-house teams.' }

 * damaging credibility error on the site, and it is a Search Quality Rater
 * Guidelines negative signal on top of the commercial cost.
 *
 * They have been replaced with neutral branded monograms, which is honest.
 * Replace them with real photographs (self-hosted WebP/JPEG, square, ≥512px).
 * That is one afternoon of work and it is worth more than everything else in
 * this branch combined.
 *
 * `credentials` is intentionally empty. Populate it only with credentials that

export const contactFaqs: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: 'What is the minimum project size NovuLabs works with?', a: 'Typically $15,000 USD for a standalone module or MVP. Full enterprise platforms start from $50,000. We focus on end-to-end delivery, not hourly freelance work.' },
  { q: 'Do you sign NDAs before discussions?', a: 'Yes, mutual NDAs before any substantive technical discussion. Your IP and competitive information are protected from the first call.' },
  { q: 'Can you work alongside our existing in-house team?', a: 'Yes. Staff augmentation, co-development, and full outsourcing. Our engineers adapt to your existing stack, tools, sprint ceremonies, and communication preferences.' },
  { q: 'What compliance frameworks do you work to?', a: 'FATF, FMU Pakistan, SBP, HIPAA, HL7 FHIR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, GDPR, and Mastercard/Visa scheme requirements. To be precise about the distinction: we engineer to these standards. Where a framework issues certification, that certificate is held by the entity operating the environment, not by its development vendor.' },
  { q: 'Do you offer fixed-price or time-and-material contracts?', a: 'Both. Fixed-price for well-defined, stable requirements. Time-and-material for evolving enterprise platforms. We recommend a model after the discovery call rather than before it.' },
