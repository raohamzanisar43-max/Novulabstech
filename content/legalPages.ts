 * The footer previously linked Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie Policy

 * Neither /privacy nor /privacy-policy existed.
 *
 * That is a compliance exposure before it is an SEO one: a firm claiming HIPAA
 * and PCI-DSS work with no published privacy policy will not clear a bank's
 * vendor due diligence. Missing legal pages are also an explicit negative in
 * Google's Search Quality Rater Guidelines, and this site sits squarely in YMYL
 * territory (financial compliance, health data).

 * ⚠️ CLIENT ACTION REQUIRED: these are engineering-grade drafts written to be
 * accurate about how the site actually behaves. They are NOT legal advice and
 * have not been reviewed by a lawyer. Have counsel review before relying on
 * them, and fill the bracketed placeholders.
