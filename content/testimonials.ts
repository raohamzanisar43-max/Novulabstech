/**
 * /testimonials, client testimonials.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠️  EVERY TESTIMONIAL IN THIS FILE IS A PLACEHOLDER. NONE IS A REAL CLIENT.
 *
 * No genuine client testimonial exists anywhere in this repository or on the
 * live site, so none could be consolidated. Rather than ship an empty page or
 * invent quotes and pass them off as real, the page renders these with a
 * visible, unmissable notice saying they are samples, and every record
 * carries `placeholder: true`, which is what drives that notice.
 *
 * WHAT MUST HAPPEN BEFORE THIS PAGE IS TRUE
 *   1. Collect real, attributable feedback. A role and a sector alone
 *      ("Head of Compliance, commercial bank") is enough when an NDA prevents
 *      naming the institution; that is the same convention /portfolio already
 *      uses for unnamed clients, and it is honest.
 *   2. Replace `quote`, `role` and `sector` with the real words. Do not edit a
 *      real quote for flow; a tidied quote is no longer a quotation.
 *   3. Set `placeholder: false` on each replaced record. The sample banner
 *      disappears automatically once no record is a placeholder.
 *   4. Only then consider structured data, see the note in lib/schema.ts and
 *      app/testimonials/page.tsx.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO Review / AggregateRating SCHEMA
 * Google's review snippet policy requires reviews that are genuine, collected
 * from real customers, and not written by the business about itself. Marking up
 * placeholder text, or even real testimonials the business solicited and
 * published about itself — as `Review` with a `ratingValue` invites a manual
 * action for spammy structured data. There are no star ratings on this page
 * because nobody has given one. Do not add them to satisfy a validator.
 *
 * The copy below is written in the same voice as the rest of the site and is
 * deliberately specific about engineering, so it is usable as a starting
 * template for the real thing, but it describes no actual engagement.
