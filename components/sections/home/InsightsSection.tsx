/**
 * Homepage insights teaser.
 *
 * Added to close an internal-linking gap: the homepage linked to all seven
 * service pages and three case studies, but to zero blog posts. The homepage is
 * the strongest page on the site by inbound authority, and none of it was
 * reaching /blog/*; the articles were only linked from /blog itself and from
 * each other, so the whole editorial cluster sat one hop further from the
 * homepage than it needed to.
 *
 * Sorted by publication date rather than array order so the section does not
 * silently go stale as posts are added.
