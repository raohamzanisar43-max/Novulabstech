// LCP candidate on this page — was absent from the server HTML and only
// appeared after hydration. That delays LCP by the whole JS round trip and
// hides the image from any crawler that does not execute JavaScript.
//
// TiltCard only uses a ref and two pointer handlers, so it server-renders
// perfectly well. It is now a normal import: the markup ships in the HTML and
// the tilt attaches on hydration as a progressive enhancement.

                  "Best" is deliberately not used. It is an unverifiable
                  superlative about the business itself, which is an E-E-A-T
                  liability in a YMYL-adjacent vertical, is the kind of
                  self-declared claim Google's helpful-content guidance treats
                  as a negative signal, and in most markets a comparative
                  superiority claim in advertising requires substantiation the
                  site does not publish. The exact-match phrase is carried
                  without it; rankings for "best …" queries come from what the
                  page proves, not from the word appearing in the heading. */}
