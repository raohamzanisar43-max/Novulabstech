/**
 * Lenis smooth scrolling.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative settings. Smooth scroll is the single easiest way to
 * make a site feel broken: too much duration and the page feels like it is
 * fighting the user's input, and momentum that overshoots makes precise reading
 * impossible. `lerp` 0.12 tracks the wheel closely enough that the page still
 * feels directly manipulated.
 *
 * Interactions with the rest of the motion system:
 *
 * - `syncTouch` is left OFF. Native touch scrolling on mobile is already smooth,
 *   hardware-accelerated, and matches platform expectations. Hijacking it is the
 *   main reason smooth-scroll libraries get a bad reputation on phones.
 * - Lenis moves the page with transforms rather than firing native scroll at the
 *   same cadence, so Parallax.tsx and ScrollProgress must be driven from Lenis's
 *   own tick. Lenis dispatches a `scroll` event, which those components already
 *   listen for, so no change is needed there, but this must stay true if Lenis
 *   is ever configured with a custom wrapper.
 * - Disabled entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Animating a scroll the user
 *   initiated is exactly the class of motion that triggers vestibular symptoms.
 * - `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }` in globals.css is neutralised while Lenis
 *   is active, because the two fight each other over anchor navigation and the
 *   result is a visible double-animation.
